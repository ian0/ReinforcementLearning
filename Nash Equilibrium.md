## Nash Equilibrium
[[Game Theory]]

A Nash equilibrium is achieved when each player makes the best possible decision taking into account the other player's decision.

A common example of a Nash equilibrium is when two ice cream vendors decide to sell ice creames on a beach. Where is the optimal place for each of the vendors to place their ice cream carts? 

If we imagine the beach is 100m long then ideally vendor A would ideally pitch their cat at 25m up the beach and vendor B would be at 75m up the beach. With the two ice cream carts positioned in this way, the distance people have to walk to get ice cream is only 25m at maximum.  Both vendors will receive the same amount of customers, because, assuming an even distroibution of customers along the beach, each customer will just walk to the closest ice cream stand.

However, if one vendor moves to the middle of the beach they start to get all the customers from 50m-100m, plus customers from 37.5m-50m. People at the 100m end of the beach have to walk 50m to get to the ice cream vendor, but that vendor will get more customers.

The other vendor then has to move their ice cream cart to ensure they get an even cut of the customers. Eventually both vendors end up in the center of the beach to ensure the other vendor isnt getting more customers and the customers end up walking further for ice cream.

More formally, if you have a set n players with each player having a strategy S1 ...Sn then we know that the strategies are in Nash equilibrium, if and only if you randomly chose one of the players and gave them the chance to switch their strategy, they would have no reason to do it in a world where all other strategies remain the same.

If you have an N repeated games, the outome is N repeated Nash equilibrum.  If you have multiple Nash equilibrim how do you choose which one?
