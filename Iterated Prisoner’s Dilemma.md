## Iterated Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma

[[Prisioners Dilema]] [[Game Theory]]

In a single game of the [[Prisioners Dilema]], the best strategy is to defect.  If the game repeats over and over, then optimal strategy changes.  Cooperation can emerge as the best strategy.  However, whether the best approach is cooperation or defection is very dependant on the environment; small changes in circumstances can shift the optimum policy between selfishness and altruism. 

In the 1970s, Robert Axelrod created a tournament to allow different strategies to compete against each other.  one surprising outcome was that 'tit for tat', a strategy which mimics the other player's previous move, often won against much more sophisticated strategies.  Similiar stratgies have been identified in nature.  For example stickleback fish will pair up to scout for preditors and mimic the others behaviour.

Time, then is an important consideration in selecting a strategy to maximize reward.  

Axelrod identified 4 key attributes for the success of the tit for tat policy.
1. It was cooperative 
2. It is willing to to other poor behaviour
3. It is forgiving.  If after retaliation the opponent started to cooperate, then Tit-for-Tat returned to a cooperative stratrgy.
4. It communicated by its actions a clear and consistent message.
