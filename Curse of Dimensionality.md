## Curse of Dimensionality

"As the number of features or dimensions grows, the amount of data we need to generalize accurately grows exponentially."

This exponential growth in data causes high sparsity in the data set and unnecessarily increases storage space and processing time for the particular modelling algorithm. Think of image recognition problem of high resolution images 1280 Ã— 720 = 921,600 pixels i.e. 921600 dimensions
