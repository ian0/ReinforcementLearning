[[Markov Process]] 

## Markov Property

The history of how you ended up in a particular state doesnt matter.

“The future is independent of the past given the present”

The Markov Property makes the study of random processes easier.  A random process with the Markov property is called a [[Markov Process]]

The Markov property expresses the fact that at a given time step and knowing the current state, we won’t get any additional information about the future by gathering information about the past.

An example is a game of chess or draughts

You can look at a game of chess at any time and 
- the Current State given by current board layout
- the next state unaffected by past states
- all board states have the Markov property
