## Tragedy of the commons
[[Prisioners Dilema]][[Game Theory]]

The tragedy of the commons is an economics problem in which every individual has a short term incentive to consume a resource, at the expense of every other individual and their own long term well being.



The term was coined by William Foster Lloyd in 1833 to descirbe unregulated grazing on common ground.  The short term self-interest of the people who were using common pastures was to consume too many resources to the long term detriment of everyone. Real life exaples are the over fishing of cod stocks to the point where the cod population collapses and fishing is no longer possible.
