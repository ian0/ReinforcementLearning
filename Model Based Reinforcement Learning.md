Methods from Dynamic Programming such as Policy Iteration and Value Iteration are known as Model Based Methods

They require a complete model of the environment in order to learn optimal policies.
A complete model
- Set of all states (S)
- Set of all actions (A)
- Transition probabilities (T)
- Rewards (R)
