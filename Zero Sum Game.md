## Zero Sum Game

[[Game Theory]] [[Non Zero Sum]]

In a zero sum gain, one persons gain is another loss so the net change it total reward is zero.  

A zero sum game can have from 2 to millions of participants.  Poker and gambling are  examples of zero-sum games.  At a poker table, the amount of money on the table remains constant.  The player who walks away with the money changes.  

An example of a zero sum game in [[Game Theory]] is the pennies games.  Two players place a penny on the table at the same time.  If both pennies are the same, player A wins, if they differ then player B wins.
