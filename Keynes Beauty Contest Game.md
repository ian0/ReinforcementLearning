## Keynes Beauty Contest Game

[[Nash Equilibrium]] [[Game Theory]]

“Keynes Beauty Contest Game”. In this game, every player is asked to pick a number between 1 and 100. The player that names a number closest to two thirds the average of all numbers chosen will then be announced the winner, all others receive nothing.

This question ass us to explain the game and the role of Nash Equilibrium.  If we assume that all the players are rational then the game will proceed as follows.

If the average play was any number N, then the optimal choice is to pick a number 2/3 of N.  We have upper and lower bounds of 1 to 100, so the optimal strategy has to be 67 or less.

So now the upper bound is 67, and the optimal strategy of any player is 2/3 of 67.  So then we enter into a loop of decreasing 2/3's until finally we arrive at the lowest possible number, 1.  So if all players are acting rationally, they will all pick 1.
