## Game Theory

[[Reinforcement Learning]]

Game Theory can be described as the mathematics of conflicts of interest when trying to make optimal choices.

It applies to RL when we start to consider Multiple agents instead of a single agent.

Game Theory has its roots in Economics, but is now used in Politics, Sociology among other.

What game theory sort of captures is ways of thinking about what happens when you're not the only thing with intention in the world and how do you incorporate other goals from other people who may or may not  have your best interest at heart.
