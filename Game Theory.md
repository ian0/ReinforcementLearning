## Game Theory

[[Reinforcement Learning]]

Game Theory can be described as the mathematics of conflicts of interest when trying to make optimal choices.

It applies to RL when we start to consider Multiple agents instead of a single agent.

Game Theory has its roots in Economics, but is now used in Politics, Sociology among other.

What game theory captures are ways of thinking about what happens when you're not the only agent with intention in the world and how it is possible to incorporate other goals from other agents who may or may not  have your best interest at heart.
