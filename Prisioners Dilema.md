## Prisioners Dilemma

[[Game Theory]]

The prisioners dilemma demonstrates the conflict between doing what's best for yourself as an individual versus the best possible outcome when acting within a group.

The standard prisoners dilema describes two people people who have been arrested on suspicion of robbing a bank.  They have to independently make a decision that impacts both of them without talking to each other, so the dilema is do they get the best outcome if they cooperate or defect.

If there are two prisioners, A and B who have both been arrested for robbery.  The police are talking to them independantly and offer them both a deal if they will betray the other person.  The deal is if they testify against the other person they will be let go, but the other person will get 9 years.  If they both betray and testify against each other they will get 5 years, but if they both remain silent they will only get 1 year for minor charges.

The dilemma is that each person gets a better outcome (i.e., less jail time) if they betray the other person. So regardless of what the other person does, each person reduces their own jail time by betraying the other person.  They both get the best outcome if both of them don't betray the other person but they can't communicate to make sure that the other agrees.

If both A and B are rational they will betray the other person, and they both end up with a bad, though not the worst outcome.

This is described as a 2 player, [[Non Zero Sum]] non deterministic game of hidden information. 

It's an important game theory game because it describes the dynamics of complicated real-world situations in simple terms.  It is an example of  the [[Tragedy of the commons]].

How to overcome the prisoners dilemma?  You need to play the game more than once. [[Iterated Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma]]
