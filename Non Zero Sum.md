## Non Zero Sum Game

[[Prisioners Dilema]] [[Zero Sum Game]]

Non-zero-sum games differ from [[Zero Sum Game]] in that there is no universally accepted solution. There is no single optimal strategy that is preferable to all others, nor is there a predictable outcome.  They may also be cooperative as well as competitive.  Players may share some common goals and also have some opposing interests.  

Different outcomes can occur if communication is allowed or disallowed in the game.
